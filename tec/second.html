                    <p>CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way.
                    </p>
                    <p>CSS is the acronym for "Cascading Style Sheet". This tutorial covers both the versions CSS1,CSS2
                        and CSS3, and gives a complete understanding of CSS, starting from its basics to advanced
                        concepts.</p>

                    <h2>Why to Learn CSS?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to
                        simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
                    </p>
                    <p>CSS is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer
                        specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key
                        advantages of learning CSS:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Create Stunning Web site : </strong>
                            <p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of
                                the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and
                                laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in
                                display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

                            <p> CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the
                                presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup
                                languages HTML or XHTML.</p>
                        </li>

                    <h2>Inclusion</h2>
                    <p>There are four ways to associate styles with your HTML document. Most commonly used methods are
                        inline CSS and External CSS.</p>

                    <h3>Embedded CSS </h3>
                    <p>The style Element -You can put your CSS rules into an HTML document using the style element. This
                        tag is placed inside the head.head tags. Rules defined using this syntax will be applied to all
                        the elements available in the document. </p>

                    <h3>Inline CSS </h3>
                    <p>The style Attribute -You can use style attribute of any HTML element to define style rules. These
                        rules will be applied to that element only.</p>

                    <h3>External CSS</h3>
                    <p> The link element can be used to include an external stylesheet file in your HTML document. An
                        external style sheet is a separate text file with .css extension. You define all the Style rules
                        within this text file and then you can include this file in any HTML document using link
                        element.</p>

                    <h3>Imported CSS</h3>
                    <p>@import Rule- @import is used to import an external stylesheet in a manner similar to the link
                        element. </p>

                    <h2>Colors</h2>
                    <p>CSS uses color values to specify a color. Typically, these are used to set a color either for the
                        foreground of an element (i.e., its text) or else for the background of the element. They can
                        also be used to affect the color of borders and other decorative effects.</p>

                    <h3>Hex Codes</h3>
                    <p>
                        A hexadecimal is a 6 digit representation of a color. The first two digits(RR) represent a red
                        value, the next two are a green value(GG), and the last are the blue value(BB).</p>
                    <p>
                        Each hexadecimal code will be preceded by a pound or hash sign '#'. Following are the examples
                        to use Hexadecimal notation.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Short Hex Codes</h3>
                    <p> This is a shorter form of the six-digit notation. In this format, each digit is replicated to
                        arrive at an equivalent six-digit value. For example: #6A7 becomes #66AA77.</p>

                    <h3>RGB Values</h3>
                    <p>This color value is specified using the rgb( ) property. This property takes three values, one
                        each for red, green, and blue. The value can be an integer between 0 and 255 or a percentage.

                    <h2>Image</h2>
                    <p>mages play an important role in any webpage. Though it is not recommended to include a lot of
                        images, but it is still important to use good images wherever required.</p>
                    <p>CSS plays a good role to control image display. You can set the following image properties using
                        CSS.</p>

                    <h3>The Image Border Property</h3>
                    <p>The border property of an image is used to set the width of an image border. This property can
                        have a value in length or in %. A width of zero pixels means no border.</p>

                    <h3>The Image Height Property</h3>
                    <p> The height property of an image is used to set the height of an image. This property can have a
                        value in length or in %. While giving value in %, it applies it in respect of the box in which
                        an image is available.</p>

                    <h3>The Image Width Property</h3>
                    <p>The width property of an image is used to set the width of an image. This property can have a

                    <h2>Positioning</h2>
                    <p>CSS helps you to position your HTML element. You can put any HTML element at whatever location
                        you like. You can specify whether you want the element positioned relative to its natural
                        position in the page or absolute based on its parent element.</p>

                    <h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
                    <p>Relative positioning changes the position of the HTML element relative to where it normally
                        appears. So "left:20" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position.</p>

                    <h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
                    <p>An element with position: absolute is positioned at the specified coordinates relative to your
                        screen top-left corner.</p>

                    <h3>Fixed Positioning</h3>
                    <p>Fixed positioning allows you to fix the position of an element to a particular spot on the page,
                        regardless of scrolling. Specified coordinates will be relative to the browser window.</p>
