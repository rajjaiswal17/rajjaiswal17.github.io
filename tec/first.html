                    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to
                        develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first
                        standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML
                        and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are
                        having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in
                        2012.</p>

                <section id="2">
                    <h2>Heading Tags</h2>
                    <p>
                        Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has
                        six levels of headings, which use the elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. While displaying any
                        heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.</p>

                    <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
                    <p>
                        The p tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text
                        should go in between an opening p and a closing p tag.</p>

                    <h3>Line Break Tag</h3>
                    <p>
                        Whenever you use the br element, anything following it starts from the next line. This tag is an
                        example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing
                        to go in between them.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Centering Content</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can use center tag to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Horizontal Lines</h3>
                    <p>
                        Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The
                        hr tag creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks
                        the line accordingly.
                    </p>

                    <h2>HTML Element</h2>
                    <p>An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with
                        a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash</p>

                    <p>HTML documents consists of a tree of these elements and they specify how HTML documents should be
                        built, and what kind of content should be placed in what part of an HTML document.</p>

                    <h3>HTML Tag vs. Element</h3>
                    <p>An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it with a
                        closing tag.</p>

                    <h3>Nested HTML Elements</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is very much allowed to keep one HTML element inside another HTML element</p>

                    <h2>Attribute</h2>
                    <p>We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags h1, h1, paragraph tag p and other
                        tags. We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the HTML tags can also have
                        attributes, which are extra bits of information.
                    </p>

                    <p>An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the
                        element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>name </strong> is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph p
                            element in the example carries an attribute whose name is align, which you can use to
                            indicate the alignment of paragraph on the page.</li>
                        <li>The <strong> value</strong> is what you want the value of the property to be set and always
                            put within quotations. The below example shows three possible values of align attribute:
                            left, center and right.</li>
                    </ul>

            <div>
                <section id="5">
                    <h2>List</h2>
                    <p>HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain
                        one or more list elements. Lists may contain :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> ul − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.</li>
                        <li>
                            dl − A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are in a
                            dictionary. </li>
                        <li>
                            ol − An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>HTML Unordered Lists</h3>
                    <p>
                        An unordered list is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence. This
                        list is created by using HTML ul tag. Each item in the list is marked with a bullet.</p>

                    <h3>HTML Ordered Lists</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you are required to put your items in a numbered list instead of bulleted, then HTML ordered
                        list will be used. This list is created by using ol tag. The numbering starts at one and is
                        incremented by one for each successive ordered list element tagged with li.</p>

                    <h3>HTML Definition Lists</h3>
                    <p>
                        HTML and XHTML supports a list style which is called definition lists where entries are listed
                        like in a dictionary or encyclopedia. The definition list is the ideal way to present a
                        glossary, list of terms, or other name/value list.
                    </p>
                    <p> Definition List makes use of following three tags.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> dl − Defines the start of the list</li>
                        <li> dt − A term</li>
                        <li>dd − Term definition</li>

                    </ul>
                </section>
            </div>

            <div>
                <section id="6">
                    <h2>Link</h2>
                    <p>A webpage can contain various links that take you directly to other pages and even specific parts
                        of a given page. These links are known as hyperlinks.
                    </p>
                    <p> Hyperlinks allow visitors to navigate between Web sites by clicking on words, phrases, and
                        images. Thus you can create hyperlinks using text or images available on a webpage.</p>
                    <h3>Linking Documents</h3>
                    <p>
                        A link is specified using HTML tag a. This tag is called anchor tag and anything between the
                        opening a tag and the closing a tag becomes part of the link and a user can click that part to
                        reach to the linked document. Following is the simple syntax to use a tag.</p>\

                    <h3>Use of Base Path</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you link HTML documents related to the same website, it is not required to give a complete
                        URL for every link. You can get rid of it if you use base tag in your HTML document header. This
                        tag is used to give a base path for all the links. So your browser will concatenate given
                        relative path to this base path and will make a complete URL.</p>
                    <h3>The target Attribute</h3>
                    <p>
                        We have used target attribute in our previous example. This attribute is used to specify the
                        location where linked document is opened.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Frame</h2>
                    <p>HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can
                        load a separate HTML document. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a
                        frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows
                        and columns.</p>
                    <h3>Disadvantages of Frames</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are few drawbacks with using frames, so it's never recommended to use frames in your
                        webpages −</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some smaller devices cannot cope with frames often because their screen is not big enough to
                            be divided up.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sometimes your page will be displayed differently on different computers due to different
                            screen resolution.</li>
                        <li>The browser's back button might not work as the user hopes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Creating Frames</h3>
                    <p>
                        To use frames on a page we use frameset tag instead of

                        <body> tag. The frameset tag defines, how to divide the window into frames. The rows attribute
                            of frameset tag defines horizontal frames and cols attribute defines vertical frames. Each
                            frame is indicated by frame tag and it defines which HTML document shall open into the
                            frame.

                    <h2>Image</h2>
                    <p>Images are very important to beautify as well as to depict many complex concepts in simple way on
                        your web page. This tutorial will take you through simple steps to use images in your web pages.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Insert Image</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can insert any image in your web page by using img tag. Following is the simple syntax to
                        use this tag.</p>
                    <h3>Set Image Location</h3>
                    <p>
                        Usually we keep all the images in a separate directory. So let's keep HTML file test.htm in our
                        home directory and create a subdirectory images inside the home directory where we will keep our
                        image test.png.</p>

                    <h3>Set Image Width/Height</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can set image width and height based on your requirement using width and height attributes.
                        You can specify width and height of the image in terms of either pixels or percentage of its
                        actual size.</p>

                    <h3>Set Image Border</h3>
                    <p>
                        By default, image will have a border around it, you can specify border thickness in terms of
                        pixels using border attribute. A thickness of 0 means, no border around the picture.</p>

                    <h2>Table</h2>
                    <p>The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc.
                        into rows and columns of cells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The HTML tables are created using the table tag in which the tr tag is used to create table rows
                        and td tag is used to create data cells. The elements under td are regular and left aligned by
                        default</p>

                    <h3>Table Heading</h3>
                    <p>
                        Table heading can be defined using th tag. This tag will be put to replace td tag, which is used
                        to represent actual data cell. Normally you will put your top row as table heading as shown
                        below, otherwise you can use th element in any row. Headings, which are defined in th tag are
                        centered and bold by default</p>

                    <h3>Cellpadding and Cellspacing</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two attributes called cellpadding and cellspacing which you will use to adjust the
                        white space in your table cells. The cellspacing attribute defines space between table cells,
                        while cellpadding represents the distance between cell borders and the content within a cell.
